# Java
Assignments done with Java basics.
During my first year in college i started to work with Java. I had to make several assignments, to get to know about
the basics of Java.
The following three assignments i worked on had to do with making triangles. 
  Driehoeken4Rekenen 	
	Driehoeken5

	Within the assignment, InheritanceOefeningLes, i worked with the use of inheritance within Java. 	
	I also got to work with the basica of loops and arrays, which can be found in the document: loopsAndArraysBasic.
